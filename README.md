In this challenge, employee data from the 1980s-1990s at the Pewlett Hackard Company was entered into a PosgreSQL database called Pewlett_Hackard_data, using pgAdmin4. Table schema were designed for six individual tables holding the data and an ERD (ERD_Pewlett_Hackard.PNG) was created using Quick Database Diagrams (https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/). The file for the table schema is: schema_Pelwett_Hackard.sql and contains notation about the table names, primary and foreign keys. Additionally, eight queries were run to analyze the data. The notations/query description as well as the queries can be found in the file: queries_Hewlett_Packard.sql. Upon initial analysis of the data, some red flags about the integrity of the dataset (such as hundreds of people with the same last names working at the company) arose. To further examine this dataset, several of the tables (the employees, title, and salary tables) from the database were imported into Pandas, via the use of a jupyter notebook. A db_config.py file was used to hold the username and password for the database connection, but that file is not included here, by the use of gitignore for password protection. A histogram was created within the jupyter notebook to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees, as well as a bar chart showing average salary by title. The details can be found in the jupyter notebook: bonus_salary.ipynb. Additionally, the histogram and bar graph have been exported as .png files.
